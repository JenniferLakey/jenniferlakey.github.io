<h1>Jennifer Lakey – Portfolio</h1>

<h2>Professional Self-Assessment</h2>
<p>
    I am a developer and emerging technical project manager who thrives at the intersection of software 
    engineering, systems thinking, and collaborative leadership. Completing the Computer Science program 
    and building my ePortfolio has given me the opportunity to demonstrate not only my technical abilities, 
    but also the values and professional mindset that guide my work. Throughout this program, I have 
    strengthened my ability to design secure, maintainable systems, communicate clearly with diverse 
    stakeholders, and lead teams with empathy, structure, and strategic intent. These experiences have 
    shaped my professional goals and prepared me to contribute meaningfully in technical and project-driven 
    environments.
</p>

<p>
    My coursework has allowed me to showcase a wide range of strengths across the software development 
    lifecycle. In programming-intensive courses such as Programming Languages, DSA: Analysis and Design, 
    Computational Graphics and Visualization, and Mobile Architecture & Programming, I developed skills in 
    C++, Python, Java, OpenGL, and Android development. In DSA: Analysis and Design, for example, I 
    implemented and compared multiple data structures in both pseudocode and C++, evaluating their 
    performance using Big O analysis. These experiences helped me learn to write clean, modular, and 
    well-documented code while deepening my understanding of how algorithmic choices affect performance, 
    how data structures influence efficiency, and how mathematical reasoning supports everything from mesh 
    generation to physics simulation. This foundation has made me a more thoughtful and deliberate engineer 
    who can evaluate trade-offs and design solutions that balance performance, scalability, and clarity.
</p>

<p>
    My work in software engineering and database courses, including Operating Platforms, System Analysis 
    and Design, Client/Server Development, and Full Stack Development with MEAN, strengthened my ability 
    to design full systems rather than isolated components. For example, in Full Stack Development with 
    MEAN, I built an end-to-end travel management application using Angular, Express, and MongoDB, 
    integrating reusable UI components and secure authentication. In Client/Server Development, I created 
    a reusable CRUD module in Python that connected dashboard widgets to a MongoDB database, demonstrating 
    modular design and schema-aware validation. These courses also allowed me to gain valuable experience 
    with UML diagrams, requirements analysis, and architectural decision-making. Together, these skills 
    have prepared me to approach software design with a holistic mindset, ensuring that each layer of a 
    system aligns with user needs, technical constraints, and long-term maintainability.
</p>

<p>
    Security has been a consistent theme throughout my program. In Software Security and Software Test, 
    Automation & QA, I learned how to identify vulnerabilities, apply secure coding practices, and use 
    testing strategies to validate functionality and resilience. In Software Security, for example, I 
    conducted a full vulnerability assessment of a financial services application, refactored insecure 
    code, and implemented stronger encryption and dependency checks. These experiences reinforced my 
    understanding of encryption, static analysis, and defensive programming, and they shaped my belief 
    that security is not an afterthought but a core responsibility of every developer. I now approach 
    every project with a security-first mindset that anticipates risks, protects user data, and reinforces 
    trust.
</p>

<p>
    Collaboration and communication have been equally important to my development. Courses like Software 
    Development Lifecycle, System Analysis and Design, Managing/Leading in Business, and Project Management 
    helped me refine my ability to work effectively in team environments, communicate with stakeholders, 
    and lead projects with clarity and purpose. In Software Development Lifecycle, I practiced translating 
    high-level user needs into detailed user stories and acceptance criteria, gained hands-on experience 
    with Agile sprint planning by breaking requirements into iterations and estimating effort, and 
    strengthened my documentation skills through writing requirement specifications, test plans, and 
    process documentation that supported clear communication across technical and non-technical 
    stakeholders. In Project Management, I developed a comprehensive project plan with scope, timeline, 
    risk analysis, and stakeholder communication strategies. In Managing/Leading in Business, I analyzed 
    organizational culture and leadership dynamics, producing managerial recommendations grounded in 
    emotional intelligence and ethical decision-making. These experiences strengthened my leadership 
    style, which is grounded in empathy, transparency, and a commitment to helping teams thrive. They 
    also reinforced my passion for technical project management, where I can combine my engineering 
    background with my strengths in organization, communication, and strategic thinking.
</p>

<p>
    Developing my ePortfolio has been an opportunity to bring all of these skills together. It demonstrates 
    my ability to build mobile applications, design full stack systems, implement custom algorithms, and 
    integrate secure database solutions. It also reflects my growth as a communicator and leader who can 
    explain technical decisions, evaluate trade-offs, and present work in a clear and professional way. 
    The process of curating my artifacts has helped me articulate my strengths, refine my goals, and 
    recognize the value I bring to technical teams.
</p>

<p>
    As I move forward in my career, I am committed to building systems that work, teams that thrive, and 
    solutions that matter. I aim to continue growing as a technical project manager and developer who can 
    bridge the gap between engineering and leadership. My education has prepared me to contribute to 
    complex, interdisciplinary projects with confidence, curiosity, and a strong ethical foundation. I am 
    ready to bring my skills in software engineering, security, data structures, communication, and 
    collaborative leadership into a professional environment where I can support innovation and drive 
    meaningful impact.

<p>
    The artifacts that follow represent the core of my work in the Computer Science program and illustrate 
    a wide range of my technical abilities. Each artifact was selected to highlight a different dimension 
    of my skill set: software engineering and architectural design, algorithmic and mathematical reasoning, 
    and secure, data-driven backend development. Together, they form a cohesive demonstration of my ability 
    to design, analyze, and improve computing solutions across multiple domains.
</p>

<p>
    The first artifact showcases my work in mobile software engineering, focusing on lifecycle management, 
    architectural structure, and user-centered workflow design. The second artifact highlights my 
    algorithmic and computational strengths through custom mesh generation and performance-oriented 
    geometric modeling. The third artifact demonstrates my understanding of databases, data integrity, and 
    secure backend development through the transformation of an in-memory application into a persistent, 
    scalable system. Each artifact has been enhanced to strengthen its design, expand its capabilities, and 
    demonstrate specific course outcomes. Below is a detailed code review of all three artifacts, followed 
    by links to each artifact page that include the original implementation, the enhanced version, and a 
    narrative explanation of the enhancement. Together, these artifacts reflect my growth as a developer 
    and emerging technical project manager.
