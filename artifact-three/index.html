    <h1>Artifact Three – Databases</h1>

    <!-- Narrative Section -->
    <div class="section">
        <h2>Artifact Description</h2>
        <p>
            The artifact I selected for my database enhancement is my CS 320 Software Test and Automation 
            QA project. I originally created this project in 2023 as part of a course focused on unit 
            testing, validation, and object-oriented design. The project consisted of three independent 
            services (Contact, Task, and Appointment), each with its own domain class, service class, and 
            comprehensive JUnit test suite. All data was stored entirely in memory using ArrayLists, and 
            each service enforced validation rules such as ID uniqueness, field length constraints, and 
            date restrictions.
        </p>

        <p>
            The artifact demonstrated strong testing practices and clean object-oriented structure, but it 
            lacked any form of persistent storage or scalable data management. Enhancing this project 
            provided an opportunity to transform a small, in-memory application into a fully database-backed 
            system.
        </p>

        <h2>Justification for Inclusion and Skills Demonstrated</h2>
        <p>
            I chose this artifact because it represents a strong foundation for demonstrating my ability to 
            transform an in-memory application into a persistent, scalable backend system. The original 
            project already showcased my skills in validation, testing, and service-layer logic, but it had 
            a major architectural limitation: all data disappeared as soon as the program stopped running. 
            There was no persistence, no indexing, no schema, and no ability to scale beyond a classroom 
            example.
        </p>

        <p>
            Enhancing this artifact allowed me to demonstrate real-world backend engineering skills. I 
            replaced the in-memory ArrayLists with MongoDB collections, implemented full CRUD operations 
            using the MongoDB Java driver, added unique indexes to enforce ID constraints at the database 
            level, and refactored all three service classes to interact with a persistent data layer. I also 
            added structured error handling for database failures, implemented integration tests to validate 
            persistence and indexing behavior, and documented the new architecture and schema.
        </p>

        <p>
            These enhancements significantly improved the artifact’s functionality, scalability, and 
            reliability, transforming it from a simple academic exercise into a realistic backend service.
        </p>

        <h2>Alignment With Planned Course Outcomes</h2>

        <p><strong>Outcome 3 – Design and evaluate computing solutions while managing trade-offs:</strong><br>
            This enhancement required evaluating the limitations of in-memory storage and comparing 
            alternatives such as SQL vs. NoSQL databases. I selected MongoDB based on its flexibility, 
            scalability, and suitability for document-based data. I also evaluated trade-offs between 
            application-level validation and database-level constraints, and between simple list operations 
            and indexed queries.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Outcome 4 – Demonstrate innovative techniques, skills, and tools in computing practices:</strong><br>
            Integrating MongoDB required learning and applying new tools, including the MongoDB Java driver, 
            BSON document mapping, indexing strategies, and database lifecycle management. I refactored the 
            entire service layer to use repositories backed by a real database, added integration tests, and 
            implemented structured error handling. These changes demonstrate modern backend development 
            practices.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Outcome 5 – Develop a security mindset that anticipates vulnerabilities and ensures data integrity:</strong><br>
            The enhancement introduced validation at both the application and database levels, duplicate key 
            protection through unique indexes, and structured error handling for invalid operations. By 
            enforcing data integrity in multiple layers, the system is now more resilient to malformed input, 
            inconsistent state, and concurrency issues.
        </p>

        <p>
            I do not need to update my outcome coverage plan; the enhancement met all the outcomes I 
            originally targeted.
        </p>

        <h2>Reflection on the Enhancement Process</h2>
        <p>
            Enhancing this artifact taught me a great deal about real-world backend architecture and the 
            complexities that arise when moving from an in-memory system to a persistent one. One of the 
            biggest lessons was understanding how much responsibility shifts from the application to the 
            database once persistence is introduced. Instead of relying solely on Java validation and 
            ArrayList scans, I had to design collections, enforce unique indexes, and handle database-level 
            exceptions such as duplicate keys or connection failures.
        </p>

        <p>
            Another major learning experience was writing integration tests. In the original CS 320 project, 
            all tests were unit tests that validated logic in isolation. With a database in place, I had to 
            write tests that interacted with MongoDB directly, reset collections between runs, and verify 
            that CRUD operations behaved correctly at the persistence layer. This required a deeper 
            understanding of how to structure tests that are reliable, repeatable, and independent of one 
            another.
        </p>

        <p>
            I also encountered several challenges. Refactoring the services required carefully removing all 
            references to the old in-memory lists and replacing them with repository calls. Ensuring that 
            validation rules remained consistent across both the application and database layers required 
            thoughtful design. Handling dates in the Appointment service required updating deprecated 
            constructors and ensuring that tests would remain stable over time. And writing clean, 
            maintainable repository classes required learning how to map between Java objects and BSON 
            documents effectively.
        </p>

        <p>
            Despite these challenges, the enhancement significantly improved the artifact. It now supports 
            persistent storage, scalable queries, strong data integrity, and realistic error handling. The 
            project behaves much more like a real backend service, and it demonstrates my ability to design, 
            implement, and test a complete database-backed architecture.

        <h2>Enhancement Summary</h2>

        <p>
            This enhancement transformed my CS 320 project from an in-memory academic exercise into a 
            fully persistent, database-backed backend service. I integrated MongoDB, implemented CRUD 
            operations, added unique indexes, refactored all service classes, introduced structured error 
            handling, and wrote integration tests to validate persistence behavior. These improvements 
            demonstrate my ability to design scalable backend architectures, enforce data integrity, and 
            apply modern database engineering practices.
