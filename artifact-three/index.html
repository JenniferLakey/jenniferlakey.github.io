    <div class="card">
        <h2>Artifact Description</h2>
        <p>
            The artifact I selected for my database enhancement is my CS 320 Software Test and Automation
            QA project. I originally created this project in 2023 as part of a course focused on unit
            testing, validation, and object-oriented design. The project consisted of three independent
            services (Contact, Task, and Appointment), each with its own domain class, service class, and
            comprehensive JUnit test suite. All data was stored entirely in memory using ArrayLists, and
            each service enforced validation rules such as ID uniqueness, field length constraints, and
            date restrictions.
        </p>

        <p>
            The artifact demonstrated strong testing practices and clean object-oriented structure, but it
            lacked any form of persistent storage or scalable data management. Enhancing this project
            provided an opportunity to transform a small, in-memory application into a fully database-backed
            system.
        </p>

        <h2>Justification for Inclusion and Skills Demonstrated</h2>
        <p>
            I chose this artifact because it represents a strong foundation for demonstrating my ability to
            transform an in-memory application into a persistent, scalable backend system. The original
            project already showcased my skills in validation, testing, and service-layer logic, but it had
            a major architectural limitation: all data disappeared as soon as the program stopped running.
            There was no persistence, no indexing, no schema, and no ability to scale beyond a classroom
            example.
        </p>

        <p>
            Enhancing this artifact allowed me to demonstrate real-world backend engineering skills. I
            replaced the in-memory ArrayLists with MongoDB collections, implemented full CRUD operations
            using the MongoDB Java driver, added unique indexes to enforce ID constraints at the database
            level, and refactored all three service classes to interact with a persistent data layer. I also
            added structured error handling for database failures, implemented integration tests to validate
            persistence and indexing behavior, and documented the new architecture and schema.
        </p>

        <p>
            These enhancements significantly improved the artifact’s functionality, scalability, and
            reliability, transforming it from a simple academic exercise into a realistic backend service.
        </p>

        <h2>Alignment With Planned Course Outcomes</h2>

        <p><strong>Outcome 3 – Design and evaluate computing solutions while managing trade-offs:</strong><br>
            This enhancement required evaluating the limitations of in-memory storage and comparing
            alternatives such as SQL vs. NoSQL databases. I selected MongoDB based on its flexibility,
            scalability, and suitability for document-based data. I also evaluated trade-offs between
            application-level validation and database-level constraints, and between simple list operations
            and indexed queries.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Outcome 4 – Demonstrate innovative techniques, skills, and tools in computing practices:</strong><br>
            Integrating MongoDB required learning and applying new tools, including the MongoDB Java driver,
            BSON document mapping, indexing strategies, and database lifecycle management. I refactored the
            entire service layer to use repositories backed by a real database, added integration tests, and
            implemented structured error handling. These changes demonstrate modern backend development
            practices.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Outcome 5 – Develop a security mindset that anticipates vulnerabilities and ensures data integrity:</strong><br>
            The enhancement introduced validation at both the application and database levels, duplicate key
            protection through unique indexes, and structured error handling for invalid operations. By
            enforcing data integrity in multiple layers, the system is now more resilient to malformed input,
            inconsistent state, and concurrency issues.
        </p>

        <h2>Reflection on the Enhancement Process</h2>
        <p>
            Enhancing this artifact taught me a great deal about real-world backend architecture and the
            complexities that arise when moving from an in-memory system to a persistent one. One of the
            biggest lessons was understanding how much responsibility shifts from the application to the
            database once persistence is introduced. Instead of relying solely on Java validation and
            ArrayList scans, I had to design collections, enforce unique indexes, and handle database-level
            exceptions such as duplicate keys or connection failures.
        </p>

        <p>
            Another major learning experience was writing integration tests. In the original CS 320 project,
            all tests were unit tests that validated logic in isolation. With a database in place, I had to
            write tests that interacted with MongoDB directly, reset collections between runs, and verify
            that CRUD operations behaved correctly at the persistence layer. This required a deeper
            understanding of how to structure tests that are reliable, repeatable, and independent of one
            another.
        </p>

        <p>
            I also encountered several challenges. Refactoring the services required carefully removing all
            references to the old in-memory lists and replacing them with repository calls. Ensuring that
            validation rules remained consistent across both the application and database layers required
            thoughtful design. Handling dates in the Appointment service required updating deprecated
            constructors and ensuring that tests would remain stable over time. And writing clean,
            maintainable repository classes required learning how to map between Java objects and BSON
            documents effectively.
        </p>

        <p>
            Despite these challenges, the enhancement significantly improved the artifact. It now supports
            persistent storage, scalable queries, strong data integrity, and realistic error handling. The
            project behaves much more like a real backend service, and it demonstrates my ability to design,
            implement, and test a complete database-backed architecture.

        <h2>Enhancement Summary</h2>

        <p>
            This enhancement transformed my CS 320 project from an in-memory academic exercise into a
            fully persistent, database-backed backend service. I integrated MongoDB, implemented CRUD
            operations, added unique indexes, refactored all service classes, introduced structured error
            handling, and wrote integration tests to validate persistence behavior. These improvements
            demonstrate my ability to design scalable backend architectures, enforce data integrity, and
            apply modern database engineering practices.
