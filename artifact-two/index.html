        <h2>Artifact Description</h2>
        <p>
            The artifact I selected for my Category Two enhancement is the custom mesh generation module
            from my CS 330 Computational Graphics and Visualization final project. The original project
            was a fully navigable 3D scene built in modern OpenGL using C++. Although the course did not
            require students to implement their own geometric meshes, I chose to extend the rendering
            engine by designing several procedural shapes myself. These included a curved cone, a tapered
            torus, a spiral mesh, and a sine wave deformed cone. All of these meshes were implemented in
            the <em>ShapeMeshes.cpp</em> module, where I wrote the algorithms that compute vertex positions,
            normals, UV coordinates, and index buffers for each shape.
        </p>

        <p>
            For this enhancement, I focused specifically on that module. The artifact represents a
            substantial amount of original algorithmic work, mathematical modeling, and data structure
            design. This made it an ideal candidate for demonstrating my skills in algorithms and data
            structures.
        </p>

        </div>

        <h2>Justification for Inclusion and Skills Demonstrated</h2>
        <p>
            I selected this artifact because it showcases my ability to design and implement mathematically
            driven algorithms, work with dynamic data structures, and optimize computational workflows.
            Procedural mesh generation is inherently algorithmic. Each shape is defined by parametric
            equations, nested loops, and geometric transformations. The code must efficiently compute
            thousands of vertices and indices per frame, and the structure of the algorithm directly
            affects performance.
        </p>

        <p>
            The enhancement I performed adds a new parametric mesh—a fully customizable superellipsoid—
            and significantly improves the clarity, maintainability, and performance of the existing mesh
            generation code. This enhancement demonstrates several key skills:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Algorithmic optimization through precomputation, reduced trigonometric calls, and improved loop structure</li>
            <li>Data structure design using interleaved vertex arrays, index buffers, and reusable GPU resources</li>
            <li>Mathematical modeling through the construction of a parametric 3D surface defined by exponent-based curvature control</li>
            <li>Time complexity analysis explaining why vertex and index generation run in Θ(L × R) time</li>
            <li>Software engineering practices including detailed documentation and geometric reasoning</li>
            <li>Modularity and safety through isolated testing of the new mesh in a dedicated scene</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            These improvements make the artifact more professional, more maintainable, and more
            representative of my abilities as a computer science professional. In addition to demonstrating
            algorithmic and data structure skills, this enhancement also reflects my strengths in project
            management for STEM. I planned the enhancement as a structured, multi-stage task, coordinated
            mathematical modeling with performance optimization, and ensured safe integration by testing
            the new mesh in an isolated environment.
        </p>

        <h2>Alignment With Planned Course Outcomes</h2>
        <p>
            In Module One, I planned for this enhancement to demonstrate my competency in algorithmic
            reasoning, data structure design, and performance evaluation. I met those goals fully.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Outcome 3 – Design and evaluate computing solutions while managing trade-offs:</strong><br>
            I evaluated multiple approaches to mesh generation, analyzed their performance trade-offs, and
            implemented optimizations that improved runtime efficiency. I also validated the new mesh in a
            standalone test scene, demonstrating the ability to isolate and evaluate a computing solution
            independently.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Outcome 4 – Demonstrate innovative techniques, skills, and tools in computing practices:</strong><br>
            The enhancement required mathematical modeling, geometric computation, GPU buffer management,
            and optimized data structures. The new superellipsoid mesh and the refactored documentation
            demonstrate innovative, industry-aligned practices in graphics programming.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Outcome 5 – Develop a security mindset that anticipates vulnerabilities and ensures data integrity:</strong><br>
            I validated all input parameters, clamped unsafe values, and ensured that no invalid geometric
            configurations could cause rendering errors or memory issues. Testing the mesh in isolation
            further reinforces safe and controlled integration.
        </p>

        <h2>Reflection on the Enhancement Process</h2>
        <p>
            Enhancing this artifact taught me a great deal about algorithmic efficiency, geometric
            computation, and the importance of clear documentation. One of the biggest lessons was how
            dramatically precomputation can improve performance in nested loop algorithms. By moving
            trigonometric calculations out of the inner loops, I reduced unnecessary work and improved
            cache behavior, even though the overall asymptotic complexity remained Θ(n²). This reinforced
            the idea that algorithmic optimization is not only about changing complexity classes—it is
            often about reducing constant factors and improving data locality.
        </p>

        <p>
            Another major learning experience was documenting mathematical reasoning. My original meshes
            worked correctly, but the lack of clear explanations made the code harder to understand and
            maintain. Writing detailed documentation for the new superellipsoid mesh—including formulas,
            parameter descriptions, and complexity analysis—helped me articulate the underlying concepts
            more clearly and made the module more professional and portfolio-ready.
        </p>

        <p>
            I also faced challenges during the enhancement. Designing a new parametric mesh required careful
            attention to coordinate systems, exponentiation rules, and normal computation. Ensuring that the
            mesh behaved correctly under different lighting conditions required iterative testing and
            refinement. Balancing mathematical accuracy with performance required thoughtful trade-offs.
        </p>

        <p>
            Overall, this enhancement strengthened my skills in algorithmic design, data structure usage,
            mathematical modeling, and professional documentation. It also reinforced key project management
            abilities, including planning a structured, multi-stage workflow, coordinating several technical
            components, and ensuring safe, modular integration through isolated testing. Together, these
            improvements elevated the quality and clarity of a core component of my CS 330 project, making
            it a strong addition to my ePortfolio.
