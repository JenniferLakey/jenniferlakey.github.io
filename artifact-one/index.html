    <div class="card">
        <h2>Artifact Description</h2>
        <p>
            The artifact I selected for the software design and engineering category is my Inventory App from
            CS 360: Mobile Architecture and Programming. This Android application was originally created as my
            final project for that course and is built using Java, Room for data persistence, LiveData for
            reactive UI updates, and a multi-screen workflow that includes login, permissions, inventory
            management, item details, and editing. The project was designed to demonstrate mobile architecture
            principles, lifecycle management, UI and UX design, and the development of resilient, user-centered
            applications. Because it incorporates MVVM architecture, database integration, and multiple
            interactive screens, it provides a strong foundation for demonstrating software engineering and
            architectural reasoning.
        </p>

        <h2>Justification for Inclusion and Skills Demonstrated</h2>
        <p>
            I selected this artifact for my ePortfolio because it showcases my ability to design, refactor, and
            maintain a complex mobile application while applying industry-standard architectural patterns. The
            enhancement I performed, which unified the quantity update workflow across all screens, highlights
            several key software engineering skills. Before enhancement, the app contained duplicated quantity
            update logic in the InventoryAdapter, ItemDetailActivity, and EditItemActivity. This led to
            inconsistent behavior, lifecycle issues, and occasional crashes when navigating between screens.
            By centralizing this logic into a single, lifecycle-aware method in the repository and ViewModel,
            I improved maintainability, eliminated redundancy, and ensured consistent behavior across the
            entire application.
        </p>

        <p>
            This enhancement also strengthened the app’s architectural integrity. The repository now handles
            all business logic, including validation, persistence, and zero-stock notifications, while the
            ViewModel exposes a unified entry point for quantity updates. Activities and adapters no longer
            perform direct database writes, which aligns with MVVM best practices and improves testability.
            In addition, I updated documentation and comments to clearly explain the new workflow, making the
            codebase easier for future developers or hiring managers reviewing my portfolio to understand.
        </p>

        <h2>Course Outcomes Achieved</h2>
        <p>This enhancement demonstrates clear progress toward several CS 499 course outcomes.</p>

        <p><strong>Outcome 1 – Collaborative and user-centered decision making:</strong>
            This is reflected in the redesign of the mobile workflow to reduce friction, improve clarity, and
            ensure predictable behavior across screens. By centralizing logic and improving lifecycle
            consistency, the application better supports user needs and reduces confusion.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Outcome 2 – Professional communication:</strong>
            This is demonstrated through the creation of clear documentation, improved UI and UX flow
            descriptions, and structured explanations of lifecycle behavior and design decisions. These
            updates make the architecture easier for both technical and non-technical audiences to understand.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Outcome 4 – Innovative tools, techniques, and best practices:</strong>
            This is shown through the refactoring of the Android activity lifecycle, correction of state
            management issues, and implementation of best-practice mobile development patterns. Centralizing
            business logic, improving LiveData usage, and strengthening MVVM separation all reflect modern,
            industry-aligned engineering practices.
        </p>

        <p>Outcomes 3 and 5 will be addressed in later artifacts, since they relate more directly to
            algorithms, data structures, and security-focused design.
        </p>

        <h2>Reflection on the Enhancement Process</h2>
        <p>
            Enhancing this artifact taught me a great deal about architectural refactoring, lifecycle
            management, and the importance of eliminating duplicated logic in multi-screen applications.
            During the code review, I identified several issues, including repeated quantity update logic,
            inconsistent UI behavior, stale LiveData references, and occasional crashes when navigating back
            from the detail screen. I also identified that some components, such as the InventoryAdapter, were
            performing database writes directly, which violated MVVM principles and made the app harder to
            maintain.
        </p>

        <p>
            The enhancement process required me to step back and think holistically about the application’s
            workflow. I had to trace how quantity updates flowed through each screen, identify where
            inconsistencies originated, and design a unified solution that would work across all components.
            This required careful planning, debugging, and iterative refinement, which aligns closely with my
            long-term goal of moving into project management. I also strengthened my ability to communicate
            technical decisions clearly through updated comments, pseudocode, and architectural explanations.
        </p>

        <p>
            Overall, this enhancement significantly improved the reliability, maintainability, and clarity of
            the Inventory App. It also reinforced my understanding of mobile architecture and demonstrated my
            ability to apply best practices to solve real design problems. This makes the artifact a strong
            addition to my ePortfolio and an effective representation of my software engineering and project
            management capabilities.

    <!-- Enhancement Summary -->
    <div class="card">
        <h2>Enhancement Summary</h2>

        <p>
            The enhancement for this artifact focused on unifying and centralizing the quantity update workflow
            across all screens in the Inventory App. In the original implementation, quantity changes were
            handled separately in multiple components—including the InventoryAdapter, ItemDetailActivity, and
            EditItemActivity—which resulted in duplicated logic, inconsistent behavior, and occasional crashes
            when navigating between screens. By refactoring this workflow into a single, lifecycle-aware method
            within the repository and ViewModel, I eliminated redundancy, improved maintainability, and ensured
            consistent behavior throughout the application.
        </p>

        <p>
            This enhancement strengthened the architectural integrity of the project by reinforcing proper MVVM
            separation. The repository now manages all business logic, including validation, persistence, and
            zero-stock notifications, while the ViewModel exposes a unified entry point for quantity updates.
            Activities and adapters no longer perform direct database writes, which improves testability and
            aligns the application with industry-standard mobile development practices. Additionally, I updated
            documentation and comments to clearly explain the new workflow, making the codebase more accessible
            to future developers and easier for hiring managers to evaluate.
        </p>

        <p>
            Overall, this enhancement improved the reliability, clarity, and scalability of the Inventory App.
            It demonstrates my ability to identify architectural issues, design effective refactoring strategies,
            and apply best practices in software engineering. These improvements also reflect my growing
            strengths in mobile architecture, lifecycle management, and professional communication—skills that
            directly support my long-term goals in technical project management and software design leadership.
